## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styling
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - For app build process


### What I learned

This is my first Frontend Mentor challenge using React. It was a good opportunity to practice this library as I have been learning it for over 2-3 weeks.

I believe I gained a better grasp of React's essential concepts like props and state. Managing notifications state was interesting and I think I did it well enough.

Regarding the styles, I decided to use styled-components since it's another technology I've only had a little time to explore, so I thought I should use it more often to learn about more styling alternatives.

### Continued development

My goal is to continue learning about React and tackle more challenging projects, so I can confidently add this technology to my developer toolkit.

### Useful resources

- [Deploying a Static Site with Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages) - This helped me to make my first vite project deployment.
